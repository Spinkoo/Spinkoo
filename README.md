# 👋 Hi, I'm Spinkoo!

### 🧠 AI Engineer at Inria | 🛠️ Open Source Toolmaker | ♟️ Quirkiness Enthusiast

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I build open-source AI and computer vision tools that (hopefully) make life easier for humans, robots, and the occasional overambitious Roomba.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- **AI Engineering**: I create R&D roadmaps, prototype wild ideas, and implement AI-driven solutions (sometimes before my coffee).
- **Open Source**: Check out my repos for libraries and tools—if they break, consider them features.

## 🎯 Projects

Want to see what I'm working on? Here are some highlights:

### 1. [PyOctoMap](https://github.com/Spinkoo/pyoctomap)
Brings OctoMap’s 3D occupancy mapping to Python with a sleek, ready-to-run API for robotics and computer vision workflows.  
*Great for 3D reconstruction, mapping, and robotics. Built with Cython, it bridges Python and high-performance C++ code.*  

---

### 2. [Matlab2TorchRL](https://github.com/Spinkoo/Matlab2TorchRL)
A bridge for reinforcement learning research, connecting Matlab environments with PyTorch-based RL agents.  
*Ideal for researchers wanting to leverage the best of both worlds (Matlab’s simulation power + PyTorch’s deep learning flexibility). Enables fast prototyping for RL workflows.*

---

### 3. [Matlab2py](https://github.com/Spinkoo/Matlab2Py)
A Python runtime interface engine for Matlab simulations.  
*Lets you connect Python code directly with Matlab/Simulink workflows. Perfect for scientists and engineers living that double life!*  

---

### 4. [Embedded-Yolov7](https://github.com/Spinkoo/Embedded-Yolov7)
Compress, deploy, and run YOLOv7 for object detection on low-cost microcontrollers.  
*Brings deep learning to embedded devices (think: AI on a chip!). Supports ONNX, quantization, and STM32AI.*

## 📫 Where to Find Me

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wail-harrouz-65a0a6156/) (Because even AI engineers need a professional side.)

---

## 🏞️ When I’m Not Coding

- Getting checkmated in chess by 12-year-olds online
- Hiking (because GPUs can’t give you fresh air)
- Reading books—sometimes about AI taking over the human world, sometimes about humans raising dragons
