# 👋 Hi, I'm Spinkoo!

### 🧠 AI Engineer | 🛠️ Open Source Toolmaker | ♟️ Quirkiness Enthusiast

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I build open-source AI and computer vision tools that (hopefully) make life easier for humans, robots, and the occasional overambitious Roomba.

## 🚀 What I Do

- **AI Engineering**: I create R&D roadmaps, prototype wild ideas, and implement AI-driven solutions (sometimes before my coffee).
- **Open Source**: Check out my repos for libraries and tools—if they break, consider them features.
- **Prototyping**: I love turning “what if?” into “look, it works!”

## 🎯 Projects

Want to see what I'm working on?  
Just browse my repositories—let the code do the talking (it’s more eloquent than me before noon).

## 📫 Where to Find Me

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wail-harrouz-65a0a6156/) (Because even AI engineers need a professional side.)

---

## 🏞️ When I’m Not Coding

- Getting checkmated in chess by 12-year-olds online
- Hiking (because GPUs can’t give you fresh air)
- Reading books—sometimes about AI taking over the human world, sometimes about humans raising dragons

## 🎨 My Philosophy

> “Power is given only to those who dare to lower themselves and pick it up”  
> — Just like in edge computing

Thanks for stopping by—star a repo, open an issue, or just say hi!  
(If you’ve read this far, you deserve another cookie 🍪 the github page probably arleady offered you one..)
